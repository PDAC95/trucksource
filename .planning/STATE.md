# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-01)

**Core value:** A buyer can find the right part (fitment/model/slang), interact publicly, and contact the seller privately — and the seller's personal identity (name, phone, email, address) is never exposed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Privacy Model (Plan 04 of 5 complete: public seller profile at /u/[username] reads profiles_public only, count via active_listing_count RPC; route-level PII gate green)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Foundation & Privacy Model)
Plan: 04 of 5 complete in current phase
Status: Plan 01-04 executed and committed
Last activity: 2026-06-03 — Plan 01-04 complete: built the public seller profile at /u/[username] (anon-readable Server Component reading profiles_public ONLY, active-listings count derived via active_listing_count RPC, empty-listings + not-found states) and a route-level PII contract test asserting the page's exact query leaks zero PII and the RPC is anon-callable

Progress: [██████░░░░] 60% (3/5 plans in Phase 1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~16 min
- Total execution time: ~0.55 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Foundation & Privacy) | 2/5 | ~33 min | ~16 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~25 min), 01-02 (~8 min)
- Trend: faster (migration + tests vs broader scaffolding)

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-01 | ~25 min | 4 | 17 |
| 01-02 | ~8 min | 2 | 5 |
| 01-04 | ~10 min | 2 | 5 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase order follows the strict research dependency chain (privacy/RLS → taxonomy → garage → listings → intelligence/search/social/contact → admin).
- [Roadmap]: My Garage added as its own Phase 4 (optional, post-registration; reuses the fitment library); subsequent phases renumbered 5–10.
- [Roadmap]: Privacy/RLS guarantee and server-side EXIF strip are cross-cutting gates re-verified each phase, not standalone phases.
- [Roadmap]: Event logging is instrumented when listings/search ship (P5/P7), not deferred to the Analytics phase (P10).
- [Stack]: Next.js version confirmed as **16** (latest stable) on 2026-06-01, closing the open PROJECT.md "15" call. Scaffolded on 16.2.6 + React 19.2.4.
- [Infra]: Supabase **Staging-first** — Production project deferred to ~launch; all Vercel envs (Dev/Preview/Prod) point at Staging until then. Vercel project is `patricio-durans-projects/trucksource`.
- [Infra]: Pre-commit runs Prettier+ESLint on staged files only (husky+lint-staged); full typecheck + tests + build run in GitHub Actions CI.
- [Infra]: Middleware guards missing Supabase env vars — skips in dev/test, hard-fails in production (a silent unauthenticated app is worse than a loud error).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Infra] Supabase Staging email-confirmation gate enabled: Confirm email ON; Site URL http://localhost:3000; redirect allowlist http://localhost:3000/** + https://*-patricio-durans-projects.vercel.app/** (prod origin added at launch)
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] 0001_foundation_privacy applied to Staging — privacy is structural (profiles_public/profiles_private split, RLS default-deny, no anon SELECT on private); proven by the PII-keys contract test (column-absence) + RLS test.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Testing] Vitest now runs tests/integration/** against Staging with .env.local anon key; the PII denylist lives once in tests/integration/_supabase.ts as the reusable cross-cutting gate.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] active_listing_count(uuid) ships returning 0 in P1; Phase 5 rewrites only its body to count active listings.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Public-surface] /u/[username] public profile reads profiles_public ONLY via enumerated columns (zero PII), count derived via active_listing_count RPC (not stored), left cacheable (no force-dynamic) since anon-safe; route-level PII contract test mirrors the page's exact query.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Heavy-truck fitment taxonomy is product-novel (no clean ACES catalog) — flagged for /gsd:research-phase; prototype early.
- [Phase 5] EXIF strip-and-re-encode pipeline is a "looks done but isn't" trap — flagged for deeper research; needs automated no-GPS test.
- [Phase 6] Fitment Intelligence precision/recall is unproven — needs "report wrong fitment" feedback loop live to calibrate.
- [Phase 9] Contact/chat abuse + Realtime Broadcast-from-trigger pattern warrant validation beyond the happy path.
- [Pre-Phase 5] Supabase plan decision (Image Transformations free vs Pro) affects upload pipeline.
