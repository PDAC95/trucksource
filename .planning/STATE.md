# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-01)

**Core value:** A buyer can find the right part (fitment/model/slang), interact publicly, and contact the seller privately — and the seller's personal identity (name, phone, email, address) is never exposed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Privacy Model COMPLETE & fully verified (5/5). Auth flows (01-03), public profile (01-04), and e2e verification (01-05) all done. Live confirmation-email round-trip verified end-to-end on 2026-06-03 after wiring Resend as custom SMTP (register → email → confirm → app; public /u/<username> renders with zero PII in HTML + RSC payload). Next: Phase 2 — Verified Seller / OTP.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Foundation & Privacy Model) — COMPLETE & VERIFIED
Plan: 5 of 5 complete in current phase
Status: Phase 1 fully verified — all 5 plans executed and committed; the live email confirmation round-trip + value-level /u/<username> no-PII render were verified end-to-end on 2026-06-03 after wiring Resend as custom SMTP. No outstanding verification items.
Last activity: 2026-06-03 — Closed the previously-deferred email verification: wired Resend custom SMTP on Supabase Staging (lifted the 2/h built-in cap), then verified live: register → Resend email → PKCE confirm link → (app); public /u/Kenworth8561 (logged out) shows only username/ON,Canada/Member since June 2026/0 listings with ZERO PII in HTML + RSC payload. Fixed two real bugs surfaced by the round-trip (commit 2c250a3): /auth/confirm now handles the PKCE ?code via exchangeCodeForSession; UserMenu made "use client" (Radix hydration mismatch) with logout extracted to logout-action.ts.

Progress: [██████████] 100% (5/5 plans in Phase 1 — verified)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~16 min
- Total execution time: ~0.55 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Foundation & Privacy) | 2/5 | ~33 min | ~16 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~25 min), 01-02 (~8 min)
- Trend: faster (migration + tests vs broader scaffolding)

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Plan | Duration | Tasks | Files |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| 01-01 | ~25 min | 4 | 17 |
| 01-02 | ~8 min | 2 | 5 |
| 01-03 | ~21 min | 2 | 21 |
| 01-04 | ~10 min | 2 | 5 |
| 01-05 | ~18 min | 2 | 2 |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase order follows the strict research dependency chain (privacy/RLS → taxonomy → garage → listings → intelligence/search/social/contact → admin).
- [Roadmap]: My Garage added as its own Phase 4 (optional, post-registration; reuses the fitment library); subsequent phases renumbered 5–10.
- [Roadmap]: Privacy/RLS guarantee and server-side EXIF strip are cross-cutting gates re-verified each phase, not standalone phases.
- [Roadmap]: Event logging is instrumented when listings/search ship (P5/P7), not deferred to the Analytics phase (P10).
- [Stack]: Next.js version confirmed as **16** (latest stable) on 2026-06-01, closing the open PROJECT.md "15" call. Scaffolded on 16.2.6 + React 19.2.4.
- [Infra]: Supabase **Staging-first** — Production project deferred to ~launch; all Vercel envs (Dev/Preview/Prod) point at Staging until then. Vercel project is `patricio-durans-projects/trucksource`.
- [Infra]: Pre-commit runs Prettier+ESLint on staged files only (husky+lint-staged); full typecheck + tests + build run in GitHub Actions CI.
- [Infra]: Middleware guards missing Supabase env vars — skips in dev/test, hard-fails in production (a silent unauthenticated app is worse than a loud error).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Infra] Supabase Staging email-confirmation gate enabled: Confirm email ON; Site URL http://localhost:3000; redirect allowlist http://localhost:3000/** + https://*-patricio-durans-projects.vercel.app/** (prod origin added at launch)
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] 0001_foundation_privacy applied to Staging — privacy is structural (profiles_public/profiles_private split, RLS default-deny, no anon SELECT on private); proven by the PII-keys contract test (column-absence) + RLS test.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Testing] Vitest now runs tests/integration/** against Staging with .env.local anon key; the PII denylist lives once in tests/integration/_supabase.ts as the reusable cross-cutting gate.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] active_listing_count(uuid) ships returning 0 in P1; Phase 5 rewrites only its body to count active listings.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Public-surface] /u/[username] public profile reads profiles_public ONLY via enumerated columns (zero PII), count derived via active_listing_count RPC (not stored), left cacheable (no force-dynamic) since anon-safe; route-level PII contract test mirrors the page's exact query.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Confirmation gate is structural: getClaims() in the force-dynamic (app) layout redirects to /login when no claims — unconfirmed = no session. Every (app) route inherits the gate; no per-page auth checks.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Forms serialize RHF-validated values into FormData (Radix selects/checkbox don't emit native fields) and dispatch via useActionState; the Server Action re-validates the same Zod schema (trust boundary).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Routing] Removed orphaned Phase-0 (public)/page.tsx so the guarded (app) owns / as the authenticated landing (resolved a parallel-route collision).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Testing] Phase 1 **fully verified** — the privacy gate is proven structurally (contract/integration tests) AND at runtime (anon /u/<username> view-source has zero PII in HTML + RSC payload, confirmed 2026-06-03).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Infra] Supabase **built-in email service is hard-capped at 2 emails/hour and is NOT dashboard-raisable** — Custom SMTP (Resend) was wired on Staging to lift it to 30/h, which unblocked live email verification. Resend SMTP: `smtp.resend.com:465`, user `resend`, sender `onboarding@resend.dev`. The shared `resend.dev` sender only delivers to the Resend account address — a verified own/sub-domain is a pre-launch follow-up.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Supabase email confirmation links use the **PKCE `?code`** flow (not `?token_hash&type`); /auth/confirm must call `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`. Radix interactive components (DropdownMenu) must be `"use client"` to avoid hydration mismatches.

### Pending Todos

- **[Pre-launch] Verify an own/sub-domain in Resend** (e.g. `takeoffparts.com` or `mail.…`) so auth emails reach any recipient, not just the Resend account address. Centralized under the 12GA Customs Resend account (one account, one domain per brand).
- **[Minor] Replace scaffold metadata** in `app/layout.tsx` (`<title>`/description still say "Create Next App") with Take-Off Parts branding. Tracked in `.planning/phases/01-foundation-privacy-model/deferred-items.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Heavy-truck fitment taxonomy is product-novel (no clean ACES catalog) — flagged for /gsd:research-phase; prototype early.
- [Phase 5] EXIF strip-and-re-encode pipeline is a "looks done but isn't" trap — flagged for deeper research; needs automated no-GPS test.
- [Phase 6] Fitment Intelligence precision/recall is unproven — needs "report wrong fitment" feedback loop live to calibrate.
- [Phase 9] Contact/chat abuse + Realtime Broadcast-from-trigger pattern warrant validation beyond the happy path.
- [Pre-Phase 5] Supabase plan decision (Image Transformations free vs Pro) affects upload pipeline.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-03
Stopped at: Phase 1 fully verified — wired Resend custom SMTP, verified the live email round-trip + anon public-profile no-PII render end-to-end, and fixed the two bugs it surfaced (PKCE confirm + UserMenu hydration). Next: plan/execute Phase 2 (Verified Seller / OTP). Optional first: /gsd:discuss-phase 2 to pin Twilio OTP + anti SMS-pumping + Verified-badge decisions.
