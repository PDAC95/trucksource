# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-01)

**Core value:** A buyer can find the right part (fitment/model/slang), interact publicly, and contact the seller privately — and the seller's personal identity (name, phone, email, address) is never exposed.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Verified Seller / Phone OTP. Plan 02-02 done: the two pure foundation modules (toE164Plus1 +1-only geo normalizer + the shared wizard Zod schemas) the rest of the phase builds on. Next: Plan 02-03 (OTP send/check Server Actions + anti-abuse stack), then wizard UI and the verified badge.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 11 (Verified Seller / Phone OTP) — IN PROGRESS
Plan: 02-02 of 5 complete (02-01 + 02-02 done; 02-03, 02-04, 02-05 pending)
Status: 02-02 complete & committed — TDD'd toE164Plus1 (8 unit tests green) and authored lib/verify/schema.ts (sendOtp/checkOtp/acceptTerms + TERMS_VERSION). Full vitest suite green (40 passed, 1 self-skipped), tsc --noEmit clean. twilio/botid/libphonenumber-js installed.
Last activity: 2026-06-03 — Plan 02-02: +1-only E.164 normalizer (geo allowlist, free first line of defense; rejects UK/MX before any paid Twilio send) + the single client+server Zod schema set for the verification wizard. Note: supabase/migrations/0002_verification.sql landed in commit 070c774 (pre-existing stashed work restored by the pre-commit hook) — Plan 02-03 should treat it as already committed, not re-author.

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] ~20% (2/5 plans in Phase 2)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~16 min
- Total execution time: ~0.55 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 (Foundation & Privacy) | 2/5 | ~33 min | ~16 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~25 min), 01-02 (~8 min)
- Trend: faster (migration + tests vs broader scaffolding)

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Phase order follows the strict research dependency chain (privacy/RLS → taxonomy → garage → listings → intelligence/search/social/contact → admin).
- [Roadmap]: My Garage added as its own Phase 4 (optional, post-registration; reuses the fitment library); subsequent phases renumbered 5–10.
- [Roadmap]: Privacy/RLS guarantee and server-side EXIF strip are cross-cutting gates re-verified each phase, not standalone phases.
- [Roadmap]: Event logging is instrumented when listings/search ship (P5/P7), not deferred to the Analytics phase (P10).
- [Stack]: Next.js version confirmed as **16** (latest stable) on 2026-06-01, closing the open PROJECT.md "15" call. Scaffolded on 16.2.6 + React 19.2.4.
- [Infra]: Supabase **Staging-first** — Production project deferred to ~launch; all Vercel envs (Dev/Preview/Prod) point at Staging until then. Vercel project is `patricio-durans-projects/trucksource`.
- [Infra]: Pre-commit runs Prettier+ESLint on staged files only (husky+lint-staged); full typecheck + tests + build run in GitHub Actions CI.
- [Infra]: Middleware guards missing Supabase env vars — skips in dev/test, hard-fails in production (a silent unauthenticated app is worse than a loud error).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Infra] Supabase Staging email-confirmation gate enabled: Confirm email ON; Site URL http://localhost:3000; redirect allowlist http://localhost:3000/** + https://*-patricio-durans-projects.vercel.app/** (prod origin added at launch)
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] 0001_foundation_privacy applied to Staging — privacy is structural (profiles_public/profiles_private split, RLS default-deny, no anon SELECT on private); proven by the PII-keys contract test (column-absence) + RLS test.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Testing] Vitest now runs tests/integration/** against Staging with .env.local anon key; the PII denylist lives once in tests/integration/_supabase.ts as the reusable cross-cutting gate.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Privacy] active_listing_count(uuid) ships returning 0 in P1; Phase 5 rewrites only its body to count active listings.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Public-surface] /u/[username] public profile reads profiles_public ONLY via enumerated columns (zero PII), count derived via active_listing_count RPC (not stored), left cacheable (no force-dynamic) since anon-safe; route-level PII contract test mirrors the page's exact query.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Confirmation gate is structural: getClaims() in the force-dynamic (app) layout redirects to /login when no claims — unconfirmed = no session. Every (app) route inherits the gate; no per-page auth checks.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Forms serialize RHF-validated values into FormData (Radix selects/checkbox don't emit native fields) and dispatch via useActionState; the Server Action re-validates the same Zod schema (trust boundary).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Routing] Removed orphaned Phase-0 (public)/page.tsx so the guarded (app) owns / as the authenticated landing (resolved a parallel-route collision).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Testing] Phase 1 **fully verified** — the privacy gate is proven structurally (contract/integration tests) AND at runtime (anon /u/<username> view-source has zero PII in HTML + RSC payload, confirmed 2026-06-03).
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Infra] Supabase **built-in email service is hard-capped at 2 emails/hour and is NOT dashboard-raisable** — Custom SMTP (Resend) was wired on Staging to lift it to 30/h, which unblocked live email verification. Resend SMTP: `smtp.resend.com:465`, user `resend`, sender `onboarding@resend.dev`. The shared `resend.dev` sender only delivers to the Resend account address — a verified own/sub-domain is a pre-launch follow-up.
- [Phase 01-foundation-privacy-model]: [Auth] Supabase email confirmation links use the **PKCE `?code`** flow (not `?token_hash&type`); /auth/confirm must call `exchangeCodeForSession(code)`. Radix interactive components (DropdownMenu) must be `"use client"` to avoid hydration mismatches.
- [Phase 02-verified-seller-phone-otp]: [Verify] Geo gate is a pure local function (toE164Plus1, +1/US-CA only) that runs BEFORE any Twilio call — non-+1 numbers (UK/MX) rejected free; region enforcement is NOT duplicated in the Zod phone field.
- [Phase 02-verified-seller-phone-otp]: [Verify] sendOtpSchema/checkOtpSchema/acceptTermsSchema are the single client+server source of truth; TERMS_VERSION='2026-06-03' stamps the version the user saw onto terms acceptance.
- [Phase 02]: [Privacy] is_verified_seller(uuid) is a recomputed SECURITY DEFINER boolean (no stored is_verified) keyed on email_confirmed_at + phone_verified_at + marketplace_terms_accepted_at; clearing any signal auto-revokes the badge; anon sees only the boolean via RPC (mirrors active_listing_count)
- [Phase 02]: [DB] phone made nullable (registration phone = unverified pre-fill); otp_send_attempts + abuse_events are service-role-only tables (RLS enabled, zero policies = default-deny); badge keys on marketplace_terms_accepted_at, distinct from registration terms_accepted_at

### Pending Todos

- **[Pre-launch] Verify an own/sub-domain in Resend** (e.g. `takeoffparts.com` or `mail.…`) so auth emails reach any recipient, not just the Resend account address. Centralized under the 12GA Customs Resend account (one account, one domain per brand).
- **[Minor] Replace scaffold metadata** in `app/layout.tsx` (`<title>`/description still say "Create Next App") with Take-Off Parts branding. Tracked in `.planning/phases/01-foundation-privacy-model/deferred-items.md`.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3] Heavy-truck fitment taxonomy is product-novel (no clean ACES catalog) — flagged for /gsd:research-phase; prototype early.
- [Phase 5] EXIF strip-and-re-encode pipeline is a "looks done but isn't" trap — flagged for deeper research; needs automated no-GPS test.
- [Phase 6] Fitment Intelligence precision/recall is unproven — needs "report wrong fitment" feedback loop live to calibrate.
- [Phase 9] Contact/chat abuse + Realtime Broadcast-from-trigger pattern warrant validation beyond the happy path.
- [Pre-Phase 5] Supabase plan decision (Image Transformations free vs Pro) affects upload pipeline.

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-06-03
Stopped at: Completed 02-02-PLAN.md (phone normalizer + shared wizard Zod schemas). toE164Plus1 + lib/verify/schema.ts shipped with 8 green unit tests; deps (twilio/botid/libphonenumber-js) installed. Next: execute 02-03 (hardened OTP send/check Server Actions: BotID → +1 geo → rate limit → spend cap → Twilio Verify), reusing toE164Plus1 + sendOtp/checkOtp schemas. Note: 0002_verification.sql is already committed (070c774).
